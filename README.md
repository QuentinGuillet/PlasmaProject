# Project Code : Two streams instability

Hi,
In this repository, you will have all the necessary files to compute the simulation 
and analyze the movements of the particles in a plasma.
To do so, please follow those steps : 

1. Clone the directory in any empty folder
2. Create an empty results/ directory inside your git clone (next to the analysis/,Core/,execution/)
3. Run the execution/Create_data.py to launch the simulation and create the data files (approx. 1.2 GB of data) and takes 20 seconds in the computer lab
4. Run the analysis/2Stream_analysis.ipynb to analyse the results using the graphs already put in there

To compute the error curves we have in the report and understand what they are used for, please feel free to 
execute them.
They are :
1. effect_grid_spacing.py
2. energy_error.py 
3. energy_error_real.py
4. energy_error_real_time.py
5. sym_antisym.py

The codes are commented for you to understand them better.
You should have received the report by email.
If other problems occur, please feel free to contact us using our email adresses (throughout the week-end)
